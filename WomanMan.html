   <p><span>“For a man and a woman to fall in love with each other, it is not enough to laugh together,” French writer Francoise Sagan.

    Sex plays an important role in any couple's relationship.  Intimate intimacy will not become the foundation of a strong family, but without it everything will surely fall apart.
    Libido is an instinct inherent in every person since primitive times.  This term was first voiced by Sigmund Freud, who believed that our behavior directly depends on sexual desire and determines most action scenarios in everyday life.
   
    In modern psychology, the concept of sexual temperament is more common.  “This is a set of qualities that determine the level of sexual activity.  Simply put, it’s how much a person wants to have sex, and how fully he is able to realize this desire,” explains psychotherapist and sexologist Larisa Stark.  Liberation in bed, ways of expressing feelings and desires, the ability to openly discuss sensitive topics, use sexual toys, or be closed, repressed and restrained during intimacy depend on sexual temperament.
   
    The formation of temperament is influenced by indicators of two categories: physiological and socio-psychological.  This is upbringing, cultural traditions, conversations in the family, stereotypes laid down by the media and environment, personal experience and lifestyle.  Temperament is not a constant, measurable value and can change depending on hormonal levels, fatigue, comfort of the environment and relationships with a partner in everyday life.</span></p>
  
    <h4> There are three types of sexual temperament:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong (hypersexual).  People of this type are ready to have sex as often as circumstances allow.  External factors, clothing, mood and degree of overload at work do not affect the degree of their desire at all;</li>
      <li>Average. About 80% of the world's population possess it.  Moderate sexual desire may depend on external factors, mood and energy of the partner.  They may be reserved and abstain from sex depending on the situation;</li>
      <li>Weak. People of this type easily refuse intimacy.  They experience virtually no physiological attraction, and socio-psychological factors and external circumstances can easily extinguish even the faintest flame of desire.  They are very uptight, fearful and often lonely.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span>All people are different: for some, a couple of times a week is already too much, but for others, a day without sex will be wasted.  Without receiving sufficient sexual satisfaction, a person feels unhappy and defeated.  And the advice to “moderate your appetites” in this case sounds ridiculous and meaningless.  Also, the difference in temperaments can be represented in different ideas about intimacy.  For one it is romance and long foreplay, for another it is passion, fire and something “harder”.</span></p>

    <h4>Such differences in the pair lead to:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>To grievances. It’s difficult not to take regular refusals in bed personally. “No” sounds like a personal insult, creates complexes of unattractiveness, and sows doubts about one’s sexuality;</li>
      <li>To dissatisfaction. Sex is a physiological need inherent in nature. Prolonged suppression of passion leads to discomfort in both men and women, betrayal, aggression and conflicts in couples;</li>
      <li>To mutual cooling. When the bed turns into a place of constant disappointment and “let’s do it another time” sounds more and more often, there is no desire to take the initiative and show feelings.</li>
    </ul>
   
 
    <p><span>The differences that arise in sexual temperaments are not a death sentence for a relationship if there is a desire to find a compromise.</span></p>
   <h4>What to do:</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Talk. If problems arise in bed, they need to be discussed. Calm, discreet, delicate, without claims or accusations, and definitely outside the bedroom and not during sex.  If intimacy is the only part of life together that is not satisfactory in some way, then surely two adults will be able to agree and solve the problem of differences in temperaments.  Discussing your desires is as natural as satisfying them;</li>
  <li>To plan. If your work schedule is so busy that there is no energy left for sex, then you will have to fit it into your routine, taking into account the interests of your partner.  When planning, the effect of spontaneity is lost, but there is an opportunity to prepare and create the right atmosphere;</li>
  <li>Add variety. In couples who have been together for a long time, you can increase the degree of passion by trying new positions and realizing each other’s fantasies.  If both are ready, buy sex toys.  Remember your candy-bouquet period, when you were just getting to know your partner, and try again;</li>
  <li>To explore each other's tastes, discovering something new in your loved one;</li>
  <li>Change the scenery. Changing the usual scenario - “shower - bedroom - turned off the light - had sex” to the living room, bathroom, kitchen, office, or better yet, a resort hotel - will leave few people indifferent;</li>
  <li>Spend time together. We're not talking about going to a restaurant or a walk in the park, although if you haven't gone out together for a long time, this will also be beneficial.  If you want to “light up” your partner, watch erotic films together, read relevant literature, take a bath together or discuss fantasies, get a massage or arrange role-playing games - find something that will be interesting and enjoyable for both of you;</li>
  <li>To help. If you or your partner are constantly collapsed from fatigue, so that there is simply no energy left for sex, then you should reconsider your daily household tasks, help someone else or delegate some of the work in order to regain your energy and desire for a more pleasant and equally important pastime.</li>

</ul>
  
  <p><span>There should be sex in a couple!  And in such quantities that both feel satisfied and happy.  The quality of intimate life determines the climate in the family, success at work and general mood, the ability for creative breakthroughs and creative development.

    So now is the best time to show this article to your other half and together choose a scenario for a pleasant and useful continuation of the evening...</span></p>
