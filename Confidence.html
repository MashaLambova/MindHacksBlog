      <p><span>To achieve results in their business, many people lack one thing - to get rid of self-doubt. Below are four tactics that famous people shared with the author of The Big Eight that may help you.</span></p>

       <h3>1. “I have already been through this” technique:</h3>
        
       <p><span>When you have doubts about your own abilities, look back and remember your successes and achievements. Do not delve into the past, but recall in your memory situations from which you emerged victorious. Tell yourself: “I’ve already done this. I can do it this time too.” This technique works, for example, for golf legend Tiger Woods. He says that when he makes the final decisive putt, driving the ball into the hole, he thinks to himself: “You've done this thousands of times. Relax, come up and kick the ball.” Diana Bean, senior vice president of Canadian financial and insurance holding company Manulife, told me: “It's all about experience. At first you think, “I don’t know anything about this and I’ll fail.” And then you figure it out, do it, and move on to the next problem. Again you realize that you don’t know anything about it, but you assure yourself that you will figure it out and cope with it.”</span></p> When you have doubts about your own abilities, look back and remember your successes and achievements.

        <h3>2. “Overtake your doubts” technique:</h3>
        <p><span>You forget about the doubts that torment you and move forward at such a speed that they do not catch up with you. This technique is often used by the famous writer Stephen King. He says, “There are a million opportunities for self-doubt. If I write quickly, writing down the plot as it comes to mind, only checking the names and significant background of the characters, I manage to maintain the initial enthusiasm and at the same time escape from the self-doubts that are just waiting to happen.”</span></p>

        <h3>3. Technique “Balancing between confidence and doubt”</h3>
        <p><span>With its help, you suppress doubts in yourself by being confident in your business. Acclaimed Grammy Award-winning musician and composer Gary Burton describes it this way: “I think every artist walks the line between being truly great and being terrible. Sometimes I say to myself: “Well, you made a mistake.”
       And then I switch to something, do what I like, and think: “This is really cool!” Seth Godin, a popular American author of bestselling business books and illustrations for them, also uses this technique: “I constantly rush between thoughts about writing a good book and about how every page I write shows what a stupid, sullen idiot I am.” The trick to using this technique is to constantly balance between confidence and doubt. You can't stay on one side for too long.</span></p>
     <h3>4. “Sleep your doubts to sleep” technique:</h3>
     <p><span>CEO of the famous Canadian animation film studio Amberwood Productions Sheldon Wiseman says:
      “Of course, I sometimes have doubts about my own abilities. Sometimes they are very difficult, I can only wonder how I cope with them. I just don't let them crush me and try to deal with them as quickly as possible. Good sleep often helps. You get up in the morning fresh and ready to do anything.”
