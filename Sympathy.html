      <p><span>An important element of social and interpersonal relationships is compassion - one of the aspects of empathy.  The ability to empathize, show care, be kind and helpful is important not only for the people around us, but also for our own well-being.  But sometimes compassion is met with hostility, and we try by all means to avoid it.  Why is this happening.</span></p>

       <h4>Reasons why people empathize</h4>
        
       <p><span> The ability to support another person, share his emotions with him and respond to them is an important evolutionary mechanism.  Charles Darwin argued that a society in which the majority of members are compassionate will be more prosperous than one in which people are cold and selfish.  In his research, the biologist linked the success of human evolution with the evolution of compassion.  He wrote that small tribes formed into a large civilization by caring for the well-being of those around them, and this concern extended to “all sentient beings.”

        Initially, compassionate behavior only occurred during dangerous situations, such as when the sick and wounded needed help or when a group needed to protect itself from a predator attack.  Interestingly, compassion acts as the “glue” for social relationships not only in humans, but also in some species of primates.
       
        Empathy makes people humane and increases their value to others.  Its manifestation is necessary in all areas related to relationships - it helps to establish communication with friends, colleagues, partners, clients and even those people towards whom we feel antipathy.
       
        However, the ability to show empathy does not guarantee that we are ready to accept it from others.</span></p>
        
        <h4>Why is compassion not always desired?</h4>
        <p><span> If previously people showed sympathy only at the moment of threat, now they express it in a variety of circumstances, even when everything is in order.  Perhaps every person wants to share his emotions with loved ones so that they understand and support him.  But in some situations, the opposite desire may be present - for feelings to go unnoticed.</span></p>

        <h4>Ban on feelings</h4>
        <p><span> “You can’t behave this way”, “I’m afraid to talk about what I feel”, “I can imagine what the reaction will be” - these and other phrases clearly indicate that a person suppresses his emotions and is afraid to show feelings, fearing that others will not feel his way.  will understand.  The reasons for this behavior can be different, ranging from strict parental upbringing to the unspoken ban on feelings, which is present in many cultures.  For example, in China and Japan it is not customary to clearly demonstrate anger, resentment and even joy - the inhabitants of these countries are as restrained as possible in their emotions, regardless of whether they are positive or negative.
        Now imagine what will happen to people who were taught not to show their feelings if they nevertheless create a scandal or shed a stingy tear.  Most likely, there will be an acute feeling of guilt and shame, which will only worsen if strangers become witnesses to changes in behavior.  Even if those around you want to support and help, the person is unlikely to be happy with such an initiative - he will be too ashamed of the “wrongness” of his actions.</span></p>
       <h4>Fear of appearing weak</h4>
       <p><span> Brené Brown, an educator at the University of Houston, writes in her book Daring Greatly that we love to see openness in other people, and we admire it when they say things honestly, without mincing words.  But at the same time, we are afraid to follow their example.  “Vulnerability is the courage in you, the flaw in me,” Brown states. The fear of feeling weak doesn't only manifest itself in situations where we might be criticized or rejected.  Sometimes it is associated with a person’s desire to create an ideal image.  If he once decided to be a loner and, instead of friends, made himself a retinue whose task is unconditional submission and praise of his person, it will be difficult for him to accept sympathy.  Words of support will mean that this person is imperfect, and he cannot allow people to doubt his perfection.</span></p>
      <h4> Responsibility for other people's emotions</h4>
      <p><span> Sometimes a person does not show his feelings to his loved ones so as not to distract them from his own experiences: “He already has a lot of problems, I don’t want to upset him even more” or “If I’m upset, this does not mean that friends should stop enjoying life and being sad  together with me".  It’s all due to the intensity of the emotions experienced, when a person, in addition to caring about his own feelings, takes responsibility for others, believing that he must protect loved ones from everything bad that happens to him.

        Another reason for not accepting compassion may be that a person simply does not like the personality of the sympathizer.  Perhaps due to the lack of tact or love for sarcasm, it does not help, but only makes it worse.</span></p>
     
        <h4> What to do if you don't like the sympathy of others?</h4>
        <p><span> To begin with, you should understand that you cannot prevent people from feeling sympathy for you, analyzing your feelings and actions, and reacting to them depending on how close your relationship is. To avoid taking it out on others, find out the root cause of your negative attitude towards compassion.  If it is connected with your internal attitudes, you should contact a psychologist and work through them.

          The next step is to gently indicate your attitude towards words of encouragement.  Try to calmly explain to the person that you do not want to talk about this topic or want to be alone.  To soften the harshness of your words, tell him that when you are ready to discuss your experiences, you will definitely contact him.
         
          And under no circumstances take responsibility for the emotions and decisions of another person.  If a friend wanted to be with you in difficult times and provide all possible support, that’s his choice.  This means that he is ready for your pain, anger, resentment and is not afraid that they may affect his own emotional state.  You shouldn't blame yourself for showing your feelings.</span></p>
      <h4> How to show compassion to others?</h4>
      <p><span> Compassion must be based on delicacy.  There is no need to get into a person’s soul, just show him that you are nearby.  Often, an empathetic presence is more important than “objective” help.  It is also important to listen and hear.  In the first case, you need to tune in to his wave, in the second, be attentive, notice not only the words, but also facial expressions, gestures, intonation, in order to be able to penetrate the meaning that the interlocutor puts into the words.  If a person needs to talk, let him do it.  Perhaps after the monologue he will be able to understand himself better.

        You may not share his position, for example, you may not see objective reasons for suffering.  But it is important to recognize his right to feelings.  He can feel anything - anger, guilt, grief.  Don't try to convince him or prove that he is wrong, just show attention and understanding.  Having received emotional support, a person will calm down faster and be able to look at the situation with a more sober look.  And most importantly, he will not feel lonely.</span></p>
