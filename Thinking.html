    <h4>The world can feel heavy. Heartbreak. Pain. Injustice. It all weighs on us.</h4>
      <p><span>Perhaps you are going through a difficult period right now. If you're wondering, "Will everything be okay?" — the short answer is, yes. The longer answer is, it's complicated, but still yes. Bad things will continue to happen in the world. Each of us will continue to have bad days, but in the midst of bad things and bad days — there will be good things and good days.

        Life can be tough sometimes and that's part of the game.  It's easy to brush off rudeness when you're an observer, but when you're in the thick of it, no matter how hard you try, it can be difficult to overcome the overwhelm.  Everyone can tell you that everything will be fine.  But they are not you.
       
        They don't feel the pain you feel now.  How the hell did they know?
       
        Life has a funny way of working itself out and eventually working in your favor if you are patient enough.  The truth is that you are doing your best and there is no point in being so hard on yourself.
       
        You have to go through this moment right now and turn your world upside down so that your thoughts and dreams are challenged and perhaps changed for the better.
       
        It's in those moments when you doubt yourself that you begin to consider different realities, find hidden courage you didn't know you had, and change your beliefs.</span></p>
        
       <p><span>It's in those moments when you doubt yourself that you begin to consider different realities, find hidden courage you didn't know you had, and change your beliefs.

        Rejections and failures hurt.  These are those moments in life when we wonder, will everything be okay?  Is there a way out of this situation?
       
        Of course, everything will happen.  Nothing you endure will last forever.  Today it is simply part of a certain period, of which your life consists of many.  Some periods of life bring you all the fruits and pleasures you could ever dream of, and some are harsh, cold and covered with clouds that distort your perception.
       
        These may not be the best days of your life, but peace always comes.
       
        It is difficult to accept that some things are not in perfect condition.  Your mind wants to tell you all sorts of lies, like “you’re not good enough” or “you’ll never have a normal life again.”
       
        These are just lies your mind tells you to help explain where you are now.  These lies only become true when you allow the war in your head to be lost.</span></p>
      
        <p><span>We all have days when we lose a job, learn about a serious illness, lose a loved one, or deal with our own mortality.  Every few minutes you take out your phone, hoping that the answer to all your problems will suddenly appear.

          You'll naturally want to open your most used social media app to see what's going on around you.  At this moment, you will see happy moments in the lives of everyone around you, and this will only worsen your well-being.
         
          Everyone on your social media feed is having a bad day, they just don't share it.
         
          You don't always have to be okay.  Sometimes the best thing you can do is admit that you're not okay and talk to your loved ones for advice.  Accepting that you are not doing well is key.
         
          This situation can work itself out for you later, and the best part is that you will look back on it all and be wiser.
         
          Have patience and don't try to solve your huge problem in one day.
         
          Don't lose faith in yourself because that's what will help you keep fighting.
         
          Every situation happens for a reason, and you can control your reactions, the decisions you make and how you feel about it all.</span></p>
          <h4>Be kinder from now</h4>

          <p><span> When everything is fine again, let your problem be the reason why you become kinder than others.

            When someone asks you for advice, remember a day when you yourself were not okay.
           
            When that friend who cheated on you asks for your forgiveness, remember the day you were not okay.
           
            Kindness will allow you to extract the maximum value and wisdom from your experience.  Hard days can teach you a lot.
           
            Whatever you are experiencing now will resolve itself.  Know that many are also dealing with a similar battle right now, and that is why we stand together.  If everything is not going well now, everything will get better later.
           
            Have courage, treat others with kindness, practice humility, and ask for help if you need it.  No matter how bad things get, you can always ask for help.
           
            Accept what is now and that everything will be fine.
