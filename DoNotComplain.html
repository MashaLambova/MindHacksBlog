  <div class="col-md-12">
    <h4>Hundreds of years ago, Benjamin Franklin said: “Incessant complaining is gross ingratitude for all the blessings that are available to us.”</h4>
   <p><span>Every day we try to change our lives for the better, achieve our goals, travel, earn more money and buy what we want, be happy and enjoy every moment.  The search for motivation and inspiration, millions of ways to get out of your comfort zone and start moving towards a better life sometimes seem so difficult and overwhelming that you involuntarily give up.  Is not it?  Does an ideal life even exist?  Is it necessary?  There is no correct answer.  But there is an amazing technique described in Will Bowen’s book “A World Without Complaints.  Stop whining and your life will change.”  In general, the name speaks for itself.  And the obvious simplicity of this theory is quite difficult to implement in practice.</span></p>
   <p><span>Complaining is a habit, just like brushing your teeth in the morning or drinking coffee.  Have you noticed that when meeting with friends and acquaintances, we often discuss sad news and gossip, start complaining about our bosses or relatives, injustice and difficulties?  Of course, happiness loves silence, and, as a rule, people do not like to brag about their achievements, successes, and especially global plans.  But this does not mean at all that there is no middle ground and positive topics for conversation.  What can we say about our internal dialogues, mental regrets and worries about missed opportunities, mistakes and failures.  It’s scary to even imagine how much energy and internal resources these absolutely meaningless dialogues take away!</span></p>
  <p><span>Will Bowen theorized that if one percent of the world's population (currently about 70 million people) learned to live without complaints, this would trigger a change in people's consciousness.  As the movement reached six million followers, Bowen felt, in his words, the ability to influence reality through concentrated mental effort.
    The slogan of the book was the words of Maya Angelou, an American writer, poet, winner of numerous awards and more than thirty honorary doctorates: “If you don’t like something, change it.  If you can't change the situation, change your attitude towards it. Do not complain".</span></p>

    <h4>When we stop complaining, we will stop blaming other people for our mistakes, become kinder, and find more reasons to laugh and have fun.</h4>
   <p><span>There are so many complaints about the world simply because it is generally not what we would like it to be.  The human obsession with everything being bad, not going as planned, causes us to discuss difficulties and think exclusively about the bad, thereby increasing them exponentially.  By realizing that we are growing problems in our heads and communication, we can radically change the course of at least our personal history.</span></p>
   <p><span>“Complaining will never attract what you want into your life; it will only reinforce everything you don’t want.”  You want prosperity and wealth, but you think and discuss problems and failures, thereby creating a vicious circle: what you think about is what you attract.  The first step on the path to development, wealth and happiness is gratitude.  But it is impossible to complain and feel gratitude at the same time.  This means that it is impossible to fill a vessel full of negativity with goodness.  We need to free him.</span></p>   
  <p><span>As you know, it takes 21 days to consolidate any habit.  Those.  You need to live 21 days without complaints.  It took the author of the book more than eight months to complete this experiment.  He suggested using a purple bracelet as an “anchor,” which he would take off from one hand and put on the other if he ever complained.  Millions of people around the world from hundreds of countries supported this idea and noticed qualitative changes in their lives.  Volunteers sent out a huge number of parcels with bracelets to everyone who wanted to join the project.  But it’s not at all necessary to use a bracelet.  Suitable applications in gadgets and on the computer, a notepad and pen - anything can become your “clicker” for complaints.  The main thing is to notice the moment when you complained and try to control your speech.</span></p>
  <h4>“The world today is obsessed with negativity.  It is like a cloud covering the sky and preventing us from seeing the light that can illuminate and solve all our problems.”  The best part is that each of us has a choice: to participate in all this or not.</h4>
  
  <p><span>According to statistics, the most positive person complains on average from fifteen to thirty times a day.  At the same time, about 70,000 thoughts flash through the brain per day, which we are not able to consciously control.  If you stop saying complaints out loud, it will affect the subconscious flow of information.  Once you begin to control your complaints, you will be very surprised how much negativity you express regarding the weather, your well-being, and political and social problems.  As soon as you begin to control your speech, eliminating all complaints from it, your brain will automatically begin to concentrate on the positive aspects.  This is the easiest way to create your reality with the help of thoughts.  A kind of “decluttering” of speech and subconscious.</span></p>

  <h4>James Allen said this amazingly in his book “As a Man Thinks”: “The human mind can be likened to a garden, which can be consciously tended or neglected.  But whether you take care of it or not, it will bear fruit.  If you don’t throw useful seeds into the ground, weeds will sow there and produce their own kind.”</h4>
  <p><span>At the same time, living without complaints does not mean at all that you need to put up with injustice or meekly accept negative situations and someone’s mistakes without taking any action.  The difference is that you need to learn not to complain about the situation, but from a neutral position to state what you did not like or caused inconvenience: you were served incorrectly in a cafe or restaurant, sold a low-quality product - you can calmly and firmly ask to correct the situation,  without splashing out negative emotions.</span></p>
   <p><span>Not complaining means not discussing, not inaction, achieving with good what you need.  “A complaint is a counterattack against what is perceived as injustice.  A statement of fact is a neutral statement designed to inform (and not reproach) the interlocutor.”</span></p> 

    <p><span>We complain for the same reason we do everything else: we think it will benefit us.  They will feel sorry for us, help us, sympathize with us, and show attention to us and our affairs.  But actually it is not.  You can always simply ask someone for help and support if you need it, without manipulating the feelings and responsiveness of loved ones.

      Another undeniable advantage of living without complaints, which was noted by all participants in the experiment, is the feeling of happiness that comes unconsciously without visible effort.  Which is easily explained by the same subconscious, which begins to concentrate on good and bright moments.</span></p>

      <p><span>To me, this technique is somewhat reminiscent of a diet where you give up sweets and unhealthy foods: at first you break down very often, starting a new healthy life on Monday, then you manage to hold on a little longer.  And once you see tangible results, patience lasts longer.  Gradually, a healthy lifestyle and proper nutrition move from the category of diet to the usual diet, and rare delicacies no longer seem so desirable and forbidden and do not at all affect the figure, well-being and self-esteem.  And that’s when you begin to experience real pleasure and be proud of yourself!

        So why not start working on a new habit right now and a new happy life without complaints, becoming part of that one percent of the world's population that has learned to enjoy life rather than complain about it?</span></p>
