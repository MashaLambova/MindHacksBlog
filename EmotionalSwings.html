  <h3>How to cope with emotional swings?</h3>
  <h4>Is your emotional state stable throughout the day?</h4>
        <p>Do you manage to be calm about failures so that they do not affect your mood?  Or does something negative immediately turn your emotional state around?

          Imagine that you are typing on a laptop and suddenly one of the keys stops working.  You have too much to do and you don't want to be distracted by it because you have a lot on your plate.  Although just ten minutes ago you felt quite happy and confident, now this mood has disappeared, and you feel completely depressed and hopeless.  Why do things like this have to happen at the worst possible time?
          Mood changes can be a problem in everyday life.  If you don't have a diagnosed disorder, it's easy to find yourself experiencing emotional ups and downs that can be triggered by small events.  Of course, it’s nice to be on a wave of joy and optimism, but it’s always followed by a dark streak.
          Globalization of emotions and level of life satisfaction:
          You may have heard about life satisfaction studies often mentioned in the media when publishing the annual Happiness Reports ranking various countries.  However, should you know that these reports are based on simplified metrics?  The only question asked of people is to rate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10. There are no in-depth interviews or multi-factor scales that analyze specific aspects of life—just one number.</p>
        <p>Try to evaluate your satisfaction right now.  Will you feel like your number is based on a momentary assessment, or is it truly representative of your life as a whole?  It's important to consider that life satisfaction can change over time, at least for some people, according to research by Washington University in St. Louis psychologist Emily Willroth and her colleagues.  Those who engage in “globalization of emotions” allow the influence of their current mood on assessments of life satisfaction.
          In addition to creating a lot of noise in the world's happiness data, this globalization trend may cause some people's life satisfaction scores to be thrown into an emotional swing.  But who most often ends up on this swing?
          A new study led by Meagan Barlow of Wilfrid Laurier University, in which she collaborates with Willroth and other researchers, shows that people who are older and have more life experience seem to find a way to cope with the emotional swings, navigating the challenges and joys of each day.  Summarizing previous research, the authors note that this "may instill in older adults a greater awareness of the limited informational value of their current emotions in the broader context of their lives as a whole and thus reduce their level of emotional globalization."  In other words, they don't sweat the small stuff.</p>
         
          <h4>Does age matter for the globalization of emotions?</h4>
          <p> In two studies that compared samples of older and younger women divided into two age groups, a team of researchers led by Laurier examined the extent to which each age category influences the relationship between emotions and life satisfaction and how this influences emotional fluctuations.  They concluded that this occurs when a person's life satisfaction is related to current emotions.  The research team also looked at the “boundaries” of emotional globalization, i.e.  the tendency to be affected by emotions, which may vary depending on the severity of stressful events.  On a difficult day or after a stressful event, there may be a situation where people allow their low mood to affect their satisfaction with life.
          As for the methodology, participants wrote down their emotions, level of life satisfaction and stress level in a daily diary.  You can try this method yourself.
