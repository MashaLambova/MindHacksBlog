    <h4>How to get rid of overeating, constant colds and bad mood?  Sometimes it's enough to just get some sleep?</h4>
      
    <p><span>Sleep, sweet dream: how nice it is when in the morning you don’t have to go anywhere and can lie in a warm bed, exchanging mortal affairs for blissful leisurelyness.  However, in practice, few people can afford such a luxury: scientists have calculated that the average American sleeps about 7 hours a day (Russians sleep about the same), and the Japanese are content with 6 hours.  Overall, up to 70 million people worldwide do not get enough sleep.

      Neuroscientist Michael Yaffe of the University of Florida has long studied how traumatic brain injury and lack of sleep affect the brain.  In his article, he notes that back in 1942, 84% of Americans received the recommended 7-9 hours;  in 2013, only 59% could boast of this.  And if we talk about gender differences, men sleep on average 25 minutes less than women, while the majority of respondents admit that they do not get enough sleep.
     
      At the same time, it is not entirely clear how “somnological” boundaries are established: who decides how many hours should be spent in the kingdom of Morpheus?  Scientists believe that it is important to focus on your feelings (and you can also test yourself on the Epworth scale): if seven hours is enough for you to feel cheerful, then this is “your” time.  But if even after ten hours of sleep you feel exhausted and tired, it’s time not to reduce the amount of sleep, but to visit a doctor.</span></p>

       <h4>What does healthy sleep bring us?</h4>
        
       <p><span>Lack of sleep isn't limited to just fatigue: Researchers have found that sleep deprivation can negatively impact synaptic plasticity and memory encoding, leading to inattention and distraction.</span></p>
       <p><span>And children who sleep less than expected usually have about ten chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, asthma, depression, and obesity.  True, it is not entirely clear whether the fact is that an incorrect regimen leads to health problems, or, on the contrary, it is these diseases that contribute to sleep disorders.  For example, hyperthyroidism, a disease of the thyroid gland, makes a child hyperactive and can cause insomnia.

        Interestingly, lack of sleep has a direct connection with overeating.  Thus, in one of her lectures, scientific journalist Asya Kazantseva noted that people who do not get enough sleep usually gain weight, as insulin sensitivity decreases.
       
        When we eat, sugar enters the blood, and if we sleep as much as required, the cells receive “insulin signals” and begin to use sugar, but if not, the cells lose sensitivity to insulin, which in the worst case, after some time can lead to  to the development of type 2 diabetes.
       
        Plus, the release of leptin, which is responsible for regulating energy metabolism, decreases, and the release of ghrelin, the “hunger hormone,” on the contrary, increases, which only increases our appetite.</span></p>
        <p><span>The situation with immunity is no better: due to insufficient sleep, immune cells risk losing the fight against malignant tumors, antibodies to influenza and resistance to infection are also reduced.

          Lack of sleep excites the sympathetic nervous system, causing a “fight or flight” response: blood pressure rises, the heart begins to beat faster, the endocrine system releases more cortisol, the stress hormone - in general, it doesn’t feel very good, and it’s clearly not good for your health.
         
          Lack of sleep, of course, affects your social life - as you might guess, also negatively.  In addition to the fact that you always feel a lack of energy and irritation, which prevents you from adequately communicating with others, you also run the risk of being on sick leave more often (hello, damaged immunity) and even becoming involved in an accident: Yaffe refers to studies in which lack of sleep is correlated with an increase in the number of  car accidents.</span></p>

        <h4>...what about our brain?</h4>
        <p><span> The fact that lack of sleep interferes with the memorization of information has been known for quite some time.  But in new studies, scientists were able to come to sensational conclusions: it turns out that during sleep, the glymphatic system (by the way, it was discovered only in 2012), a self-cleaning system of the brain that removes “protein waste,” is activated.  Otherwise, the accumulation of “harmful” amyloid beta protein leads to the destruction of neural connections and the development of Alzheimer’s disease.  Even one night, which you spent not watching colorful dreams, but, say, having fun at a wild party with friends, significantly increases the amount of beta-amyloid.

          Our sleep-wake cycle is regulated by circadian rhythms: they allow us to adapt to the 24-hour world, and the main assistant in this is light, which directly affects sleep and the release of melatonin.
         
          There are cells in the retina of our eye that interact with the “regulators” of the brain clock based in the hypothalamus, and such interaction depends specifically on light.  Thus, it was found that these neurons are exposed to blue light waves.  And this is a big problem for us: it is blue that is the “favorite” attribute of computers and smartphones, and it is blue that increases our level of anxiety, suppresses the production of melatonin and, accordingly, deceives our brain, convincing us that it is day outside the window and not night.  That’s why it makes sense to reduce the screen brightness and 2 hours before bedtime, exchange the news feed for a book.</span></p>

        <p><span>Of course, it would probably be unnecessary to say that sleep is the solution to all problems, but it is impossible to overestimate its influence, because it is often a free medicine for us and the prevention of various diseases.  And we shouldn’t discount the fact that the phenomenon of the “physiological resting state” has not yet been studied so well, so future research may still surprise us a lot.

       Give up night shifts at work, replace the evening update of your social network page with reading rustling books, don’t be shy if you need not 8, but all 10 hours of sleep - and pleasant dreams!</span></p>
