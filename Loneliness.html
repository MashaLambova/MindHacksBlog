  <div class="container mt-3">

 <p><span>It is difficult for a modern city resident to be truly alone. Colleagues, friends, passersby, people driving by, calls, messages, notifications, advertising, and so on, and so on. All the more surprising is the phenomenon of increasing cases of loneliness. Both relatively small and serious academic studies involving a large number of respondents are devoted to this topic.
  In 2015, a team of scientists led by Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Brigham Young University, reviewed published studies from January 1980 to December 2014 on the impact of loneliness and social isolation (real and perceived) on mortality. It turned out that loneliness increases the likelihood of mortality by 26% in comparable population groups and does not depend on the country of residence.</span></p>
  <p><span>And in May 2018, the World Health Organization of America (CIGNA) published a report based on the results of a survey of more than 20,000 US residents over the age of 18. Key findings from the study:
  <ul>
    <li>the impact of loneliness on mortality is comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, making it even more dangerous than obesity;</li>
    <li>generation Z (18-22 years old) and millennials (23-37 years old) feel more lonely and complain more often about their health than older generations;</li>
    <li>the use of social networks in itself does not lead to loneliness;</li>
    <li>students feel more lonely than people retiring;</li>
    <li>There is not much difference between a person's gender or race when it comes to the average loneliness index.</li>
  </ul>
    Even people who are in relationships and have many friends and social contacts are not immune from loneliness. Its main reason is not the quantity, but the difference between the expected and received depth of interaction with other people. Therefore, do not be surprised that even when you are among your loved ones or friends, this feeling may come to you.</span></p>

    <h4>Activities:</h4>
    <p><span>Don't let loneliness completely take over your thoughts. Instead of sitting still and indulging in sad thoughts, engage in some activity that requires you to be completely involved and immersed in it. It could be anything: cleaning, cooking, reading, crafting, walking, going to a museum. No matter what you do, if all your attention is devoted to the process, then there will simply be no room left for thoughts of loneliness.</span></p>

    <h4>Conduct an audit of your current contacts:</h4>
    <p><span>Take a critical look at your current relationships with others and try to determine what you are missing. Remember your feelings and sensations after communicating with this or that person. Does communicating with him bring you pleasure and joy, or, on the contrary, do you feel a loss of strength and experience negative emotions? Think about which contacts can be strengthened and made more frequent, and which ones, on the contrary, are better to stop altogether.</span></p>
    
    <h4>Analyze social media usage:</h4>
    <p><span>Social networks are just a tool for interaction, and it is up to you how to use them. Like any tool, they can bring both benefit and harm. Pay attention to the amount of time you spend on social networks, how do you feel after you go offline? Do they help you feel closer to people, or do they distract you from close one-on-one interactions in real life?</span></p>
     
    <h4>Interest group:</h4>
    <p><span>As Viktor Tsoi sang: “I’m alone, but that doesn’t mean I’m lonely.” With the help of the Internet, you can now find like-minded people from any field. Use any available means that will help you not only find “your people,” but also build deep, meaningful relationships for you.</span></p>
